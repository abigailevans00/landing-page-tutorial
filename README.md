## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Sass


### What I learned

I followed a tutorial and created a landing page challenge by Front-End Mentor.
I learned how to create variables using Sass. The landing page was made responsive to mobile devices.
This was one of the first tutorials I did, and it helped me to visualize how a design state can be achieved step-by-step.


### Continued development

I would like to improve my understanding of best practices when it comes to CSS.
